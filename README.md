A tool I'm working on to quickly perform common experimental aerodynamics calculations. These are basic aerodynamics calculations that I perform several times per day; as such, I've written a few Python scripts and my goal is to develop those into a nicely tabbed GUI for easy and quick access. At the moment, the written portions deal with PIV setups, Isentropic flow, and Choked flow calculations.
